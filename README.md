### timedata

Simple script to see the average time it takes me to complete various story point amounts.

### My Workflow

Probably not of much use to other people (unless your workflow is the same as mine). My workflow is as follows:

- Use [toggl](https://toggl.com/) to track time spent working on stuff
    - Add a workspace, as well as a "Building" project
    - In the description, make sure you include the PR number (like "#1234" with the # symbol)
    - I also have an "Addressing CR" project (for when I'm fixing issues that come up in CR), which I also track
- Use [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/) to attach Story Point estimates to GitHub tickets.

Of course, all of this will go out the window when my team migrates to Jira, but for now this works. ðŸ™ƒ
